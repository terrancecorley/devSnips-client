        <p>Welcome! devSnips was designed for software developers by a software developer, allowing them to create notes that contain text, images and properly formatted code fast and on-the-fly. This is achieved by the user inputting <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">markdown</a> and having our snip (our word for note) minions convert that into plain HTML behind the scenes and then presenting that back to the user. Your snips are secure and inclusive as to completely protect your privacy and data. Happy coding!</p>
